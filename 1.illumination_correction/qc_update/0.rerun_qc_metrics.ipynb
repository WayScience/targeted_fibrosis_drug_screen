    "## Update QC metrics for blur to better catch poor quality images\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data from the `cellpainting_predicts_cardiac_fibrosis` repository, the QC thresholds will be updated to better detect poor quality images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous experiment, the thresholds were working well in those conditions.\n",
    "To apply to this experiment, we will rerun the QC to find optimal thresholds for blur for all channels for only one side of the distribution.\n",
    "More negative represents blur, so we only need one threshold to catch these conditions.\n",
    "More positive/close to 0 looks to represent empty images but we don't need to catch that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well, the QC for saturation has already been updated to have a universal threshold of 0.10 or 10% of pixels can be at the maximum value. \n",
    "This is a stricter threshold that better accounts for the FOVs where cells are growing on top of each other."
