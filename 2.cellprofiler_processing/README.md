# CellProfiler segmentation and feature extraction

In this module, we apply the CellProfiler processing/analysis pipeline from the [cellpainting_predicts_cardiac_fibroblasts](https://github.com/WayScience/cellpainting_predicts_cardiac_fibrosis) repository.
We will download the most recent version of the cppipe file.
After careful manual evaluation of the segmentation parameters on this dataset, we decided to update the parameters in the dataset after downloading slightly to get better segmentation results.

## Perform analysis on date

To perform segmentation and extract morphological features, run the bash script [perform_processing.sh](./perform_processing.sh) using the command below:

```bash
# Make sure your current working dir is the 2.cellprofiler_processing folder
source perform_processing.sh
```

**It took approximately 27 hours to run segmentation and feature extraction on 4 plates at the same time with ~1,100 image sets (group of channels per FOV) per plate using a Linux-based machine running Pop_OS! LTS 22.04 with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor.**
**There is a total of 16 CPUs with 125 GB of MEM.**
